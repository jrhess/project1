Basic interface design:

First, enter oracle password and ID.

The interface has two main options.

The customer interface lets the user view and add accounts, change account information, purchase a new phone, view billing plan, and see monthly and yearly payments. Customer login requires that the user enters their customer ID number (CID). 376881 and 910306 are some customer ID numbers.

The employee interface lets the user search customers and account information based on their address, name, phone number, account number, and customer number. The user can also submit requests for a restock in inventory at a desired store and view a customers usage.

All data was created using www.mockaroo.com and hand edited.


Comments on source code:

Split into two main classes customer and employee that handle running the interface.
